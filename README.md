# Statistical Computing — Word Frequency Project

**Author:** Tirusew Ayenew Cheru  
**Course:** Statistical Computing with Dr. Michael Melese  
**Audience:** Regular Masters in Data Science students

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use **dictionaries** in Python to count the frequency of words in a block of text and save the results to a **CSV file**.  

This project is part of the lessons by **Dr. Michael Melese**, designed for regular Masters in Data Science students to practice **dictionaries and file handling in Python**.

## Files

- `dictionaries_and_files.py`  
  This Python script performs the following:
  1. Contains a large block of text stored in the variable `data`.
  2. Cleans the text (removes punctuation and converts to lowercase).
  3. Splits the text into individual words.
  4. Uses a **dictionary** to count how many times each word appears.
  5. Saves the word frequencies into a CSV file `word_count.csv`.
  6. Displays the CSV content in the terminal.

- `word_count.csv`  
  A CSV file generated by the script that lists each word and its frequency in the text.

- `README.md`  
  This file — explains the project, files, and what was learned.

## Key Concepts Learned

From Dr. Michael Melese's lesson yesterday, I learned:

- How to use **Python dictionaries** to efficiently count and store data.
- How to **read from and write to files** in Python using the `open()` function.
- How to manipulate strings and preprocess text for analysis.
- How to combine dictionaries with loops to compute statistics (like word frequency).
- How to automate the process of saving results to a **CSV file** for later analysis.

This exercise is part of the **teaching for regular Masters in Data Science students**.

## How to Run the Script

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
2. Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python dictionaries_and_files.py
